Brainfuck, in Ruby.

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)

Usage:

./bin/rbfk.rb <brainfuck source file>

OR

echo '++++++[>++++++++++<-]+++++.' | ./bin/rbfk.rb

although piping in a script that uses the "," operation won't work.

Also supports Ook! and Spoon scripts.

You can use the BrainFuck class in your own programs (why?) like so:

require '/path/to/lib/BrainFuck.rb'

program = File.open('test.bf', 'r')
#
# OR any IO stream, e.g.
# program = StreamIO.new('++++++[>++++++++++<-]+++++.')
#
bf = BrainFuck.new(program)
bf.run
