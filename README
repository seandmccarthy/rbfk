Brainfuck, in Ruby.

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)

Usage:

./bin/rbfk.rb <brainfuck source file>

OR

echo '++++++[>++++++++++<-]+++++.' | ./bin/rbfk.rb

although piping in a script this way that uses the "," operation won't work, 
since the "," operation reads from STDIN.

Also supports Ook! and Spoon scripts.

You can use the BrainFuck class in your own programs (why?) like so:

require '/path/to/lib/brain_fuck.rb'

program = File.open('test.bf', 'r')
#
# OR any IO stream, e.g.
# program = StringIO.new('++++++[>++++++++++<-]+++++.')
#
bf = BrainFuck.new(program)
bf.run
